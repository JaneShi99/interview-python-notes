__Graphs__

- Directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph with no cyces.

- _sources_: vertices with no incoming edges

- _sinks_: vertices with no outgoing edges

- _topological ordering_: an ordering of vertices in which edges from earlier ordering to a vertex in next ordering.

- A directed graph is _weakly connected_ if we change its edges to undirected edge

- A gragh is _connected_ if there exist a directed path between each pair of vertices

- A graph is _strongly connected_ if $$\exist$$ a directed path for every pair of vertices in both directions

- _Tree_: undirected graph with no cycles
